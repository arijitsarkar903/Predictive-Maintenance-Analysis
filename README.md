Overview of this project 
This project involves the analysis and visualization of a predictive maintenance dataset for a milling machine. The dataset comprises 10,000 data points with features such as air and process temperatures, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The goal is to identify relationships between these process parameters and various machine failures, including tool wear failure, heat dissipation failure, power failure, overstrain failure, and random failures. The project utilizes univariate and bivariate analyses, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots to gain insights into the factors affecting machine performance and to develop strategies for improving maintenance schedules and reducing downtime. 

Rationale of this project 
This project aims to enhance the understanding of factors leading to machine failures in milling operations through detailed analysis and visualization of relevant data. By identifying key process parameters affecting machine performance, the project seeks to develop predictive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and improve overall efficiency. The insights gained will help in implementing proactive maintenance schedules, ultimately extending the lifespan of the machinery and optimizing production processes.
