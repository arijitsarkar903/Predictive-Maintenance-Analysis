Rationale of this project 
This project aims to enhance the understanding of factors leading to machine failures in milling operations through detailed analysis and visualization of relevant data. By identifying key process parameters affecting machine performance, the project seeks to develop predictive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and improve overall efficiency. The insights gained will help in implementing proactive maintenance schedules, ultimately extending the lifespan of the machinery and optimizing production processes.
